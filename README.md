# Coding Workflow

- Take the latest master branch code
- Checkout a new branch called week-wyz (the week for the assignment you are working on)
- Develop your assignment for the week
- Create a Pull-Request and notify us via Discord/Email/Github.
- We will review it and give you the approval
- Merge it into master but take care to not delete the branch.
